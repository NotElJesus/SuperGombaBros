# Presentation Outline

Here is a file for organizing our presentation flow. 
Ideas of things to think about while presenting:  
- What is on screen? Slides or just Unity?
- Transitions between presenters (do we each plug in our own laptop for our portion? If so, we need quick talking points to eliminate downtime in transition (even just basic intros)
- Who wants to intro/conclude the presentation as a whole?
- Each person discuss documentation techniques
